### **Tagline:** *“Sugar, sparkles, and just enough sass to short-circuit your heart.”*

### **Backstory:**

Formed in a candy-colored garage studio in Malibu, **Pink Voltage** is the brainchild of four glitter-drenched rebels with a love for bubblegum beats and fierce fashion. Originally brought together by a shared obsession with Y2K pop and 80s glam rock, the girls fused their styles into a new genre they call **"Electro-Dream Pop"**—think synths, sparkle, and savage hooks.

Each member has a signature color and vibe:

* **Lola Luxe (Lead vocals)** The diva with diamond pipes and a closet full of sequins. She started as a child pageant queen turned pop powerhouse.
* **Neon Nia (DJ/Producer)** A tech-genius with a pink mohawk who programs beats like she codes dreams. Known for turning heartbreak into bangers.
* **Cherry Blaze (Guitar & Hype)** A roller-skating punk princess who shreds bubblegum rock solos and inspires crowd-wide dance breakdowns.
* **Glitta B (Rap/Style Icon)** The fashion-forward spitfire who drops pastel-colored bars with atomic confidence. A former fashion blogger turned lyrical slayer.

The band skyrocketed to fame after their debut single **“Glitter Emergency”** went viral on DollTok (a Barbie-world version of TikTok), leading to sold-out arena shows, a capsule collection with Mattel, and a Saturday morning animated series.

They stand for **self-expression, friendship, fierce femininity**, and proving that **you can be plastic and still be fantastic**.", 12, "A1B4", 100, "fdc42b2d941e8c6f7b38d974df3music", "pop", "https://lager.emilfolino.se/img/pink_voltage.png");

**ECLIPSE⁷** is a seven-member boy band formed under the futuristic entertainment label *AuroraSound*. The group debuted after being selected from a brutal survival show called *'Lightfall: Origins.'* Each member represents a celestial body or phase of the moon, and their story-driven concept explores the duality between **light and shadow**, **dreams and reality**, and **past and future**.

### **Tagline:** *Floppy Disks, Full Hearts.*

---

### **Backstory:**

**HeartDrive** burst onto the scene in 1999 with frosted tips, tearaway pants, and harmonies smoother than their baby-oiled six-packs. Originally pitched as the edgier alternative to \*NSYNC and Westlife, the group blended R\&B vocals with pop hooks and just enough bad-boy eyeliner to make teen hearts implode.

Their mega-hit debut album **“Reboot My Heart”** featured tracks like:

* *“Ctrl+U”* (a ballad for long-distance love)
* *“Instant Messenger”*
* *“No Signal (Still Love U)”*
* *“Boyband.exe”*

They were everywhere: TRL, cereal boxes, your older sister's locker door.

After their popularity waned by 2005, the members pursued solo careers (with varying degrees of success): acting gigs, reality TV meltdowns, and one surprisingly decent vegan cookbook.

---

### **The Comeback:**

In 2025, they've reunited as **HeartDrive 2.0**—now in their 40s and 50s—with dad energy, grown-up vocals, and emotionally raw lyrics about aging, fatherhood, and lost youth… with just a hint of old-school flirtation.

Their comeback album **“Patch Notes”** is a synthy, melancholic pop record laced with acoustic moments and self-aware humor. They've become Gen X's emotional support band—and Gen Z's ironic obsession.

### **Backstory:**

**Ashes of Eden** formed in the early 2000s underground alt-rock scene in Detroit. The group gained notoriety for their cinematic sound—blending soaring female vocals with chugging guitar riffs, orchestral strings, and haunting piano. Initially dismissed as “just another Evanescence clone,” they carved their own path with lyrics focused on **loss, resurrection, rage, and rebirth**.

Their frontwoman, **Vesper Vale**, has become iconic for her operatic range, black lace stagewear, and poetic lyrics that pull from mythology, psychology, and religious symbolism.

After a brief breakup in 2013, the band reunited in 2024 and began releasing new material with a heavier, darker tone and deeply personal themes rooted in survival and transformation.

### 🧨 **Backstory:**

Formed in the neon underworld of the Sunset Strip in 1987, **Lipstick Guillotine** were the beautiful, broken-hearted devils your parents warned you about. Drenched in leather, hairspray, and just enough tragedy, they crashed onto the glam scene with vicious charm and arena-filling hooks.

After a legendary tour in 1991 ended with a **stage fire, a public breakup**, and one mysterious disappearance (their original drummer, Spazzy Razzy, was last seen in a Denny's parking lot holding a Ouija board), the band faded into scandal and silence.

But in 2025—fueled by nostalgia, therapy, and the sudden viral fame of their unreleased ballad *“Bleed on Me, Angel”*—the surviving members have returned to **reclaim the throne** of neon-stained heartbreak and razor-sharp riffs.

### 🩻 **Backstory:**

**Crypt Womb** burst from the Norwegian underground in 2012, formed by childhood friends turned riff-slinging nihilists. Originally banned from multiple venues for using real animal bones in their stage design, the band gained a rabid cult following thanks to their **visceral sound**, **nightmare lyrics**, and an infamous live set that once included a fake onstage exorcism that fooled half the audience.

Stylistically, they blend **classic death metal** with **doom-laced breakdowns**, and lyrics soaked in Lovecraftian imagery, decay, trauma, and resurrection. Their name references the cycle of **birth from death**, and **death from birth**—and every album is a new horror chapter in that mythology.

### 🛻 **Backstory:**

**Wade Harlan** grew up in a one-stoplight town in West Texas, raised by a grandfather who taught him guitar on a porch held up by stubborn nails and prayer. After a stint in the military and a heartbreak that nearly broke him, Wade started writing songs about **loss, resilience, and long highways that never seem to end**.

He spent years playing tiny bars, truck stops, and county fairs before being discovered via a viral video of him performing *Bluebonnet Bloodline* outside a gas station during a thunderstorm. His voice—a weathered, smoky drawl—carries decades of sorrow and grit, even though he’s only in his early 30s.

Wade straddles the line between **classic outlaw country** and **modern Americana**, rejecting Nashville polish in favor of cracked boots, steel strings, and songs that cut close to the bone.

After decades off the grid—raising goats, canning her own moonshine, and living on a mountain with no internet—Granny McGraw reemerged on TikTok in 2024 after her grandson uploaded a video of her shredding on a banjo and growling out an old outlaw tune.
