### **Tagline:** *“Sugar, sparkles, and just enough sass to short-circuit your heart.”*

### **Backstory:**

Formed in a candy-colored garage studio in Malibu, **Pink Voltage** is the brainchild of four glitter-drenched rebels with a love for bubblegum beats and fierce fashion. Originally brought together by a shared obsession with Y2K pop and 80s glam rock, the girls fused their styles into a new genre they call **"Electro-Dream Pop"**—think synths, sparkle, and savage hooks.

Each member has a signature color and vibe:

* **Lola Luxe (Lead vocals)** The diva with diamond pipes and a closet full of sequins. She started as a child pageant queen turned pop powerhouse.
* **Neon Nia (DJ/Producer)** A tech-genius with a pink mohawk who programs beats like she codes dreams. Known for turning heartbreak into bangers.
* **Cherry Blaze (Guitar & Hype)** A roller-skating punk princess who shreds bubblegum rock solos and inspires crowd-wide dance breakdowns.
* **Glitta B (Rap/Style Icon)** The fashion-forward spitfire who drops pastel-colored bars with atomic confidence. A former fashion blogger turned lyrical slayer.

The band skyrocketed to fame after their debut single **“Glitter Emergency”** went viral on DollTok (a Barbie-world version of TikTok), leading to sold-out arena shows, a capsule collection with Mattel, and a Saturday morning animated series.

They stand for **self-expression, friendship, fierce femininity**, and proving that **you can be plastic and still be fantastic**.", 12, "A1B4", 100, "fdc42b2d941e8c6f7b38d974df3music", "pop", "https://lager.emilfolino.se/img/pink_voltage.png");
INSERT INTO products (productName, productDescription, stock, location, price, apiKey) VALUES ("UMBRA", "### **Band Name:** **ECLIPSE⁷**

### **Tagline:** *“Shadow meets starlight.”*

---

### **Backstory:**

**ECLIPSE⁷** is a seven-member boy band formed under the futuristic entertainment label *AuroraSound*. The group debuted after being selected from a brutal survival show called *'Lightfall: Origins.'* Each member represents a celestial body or phase of the moon, and their story-driven concept explores the duality between **light and shadow**, **dreams and reality**, and **past and future**.

They exploded onto the scene with their debut album **“UMBRA”**, which fuses synth-heavy EDM with traditional Korean instrumentation, paired with emotionally complex lyrics about self-identity, love, and transformation.

INSERT INTO products (productName, productDescription, stock, location, price, apiKey) VALUES ("Patch Notes", "### **Band Name:** **HeartDrive**

### **Tagline:** *Floppy Disks, Full Hearts.*

---

### **Backstory:**

**HeartDrive** burst onto the scene in 1999 with frosted tips, tearaway pants, and harmonies smoother than their baby-oiled six-packs. Originally pitched as the edgier alternative to \*NSYNC and Westlife, the group blended R\&B vocals with pop hooks and just enough bad-boy eyeliner to make teen hearts implode.

Their mega-hit debut album **“Reboot My Heart”** featured tracks like:

* *“Ctrl+U”* (a ballad for long-distance love)
* *“Instant Messenger”*
* *“No Signal (Still Love U)”*
* *“Boyband.exe”*

They were everywhere: TRL, cereal boxes, your older sister’s locker door.

After their popularity waned by 2005, the members pursued solo careers (with varying degrees of success): acting gigs, reality TV meltdowns, and one surprisingly decent vegan cookbook.

---

### **The Comeback:**

In 2025, they've reunited as **HeartDrive 2.0**—now in their 40s and 50s—with dad energy, grown-up vocals, and emotionally raw lyrics about aging, fatherhood, and lost youth… with just a hint of old-school flirtation.

Their comeback album **“Patch Notes”** is a synthy, melancholic pop record laced with acoustic moments and self-aware humor. They've become Gen X's emotional support band—and Gen Z's ironic obsession.

### **Members (Then → Now):**

* **Chase** The dreamy frontman turned divorced silver fox.
* **JayTee** The rapper/dancer now doing yoga and managing tech start-ups.
* **Lance** The soft-spoken falsetto, now a dad of three and part-time barista poet.
* **Romeo** The wild card; now sober, philosophical, and covered in meaningful tattoos.
* **Nickey** The baby of the group, still clinging to youth with collagen and crop tops.", 20, "A1B6", 100, "fdc42b2d941e8c6f7b38d974df3music", "pop", "https://lager.emilfolino.se/img/patch_notes.png");
